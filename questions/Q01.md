## Question

What three components make up a JSON Web Token?

## Answer

Header (the type of token - JWT - and the signing algorithm to use), payload (information about an entity that is required for the app to function), signature (a hashing function that takes in 2 parameters: the encoded header and payload separated by a dot, and a "secret phrase" - the secret is just a string of text that only the server knows, kind of like a password).

Like so:
Header.Payload.Signature
