## Question

What is Base64 and why is it used to construct a JWT?

## Answer

Base 64 is designed to represent arbitrary sequences of octets in a form that allows the use of both upper- and lowercase letters but that need not be human readable.
It's a very popular encoding format and it's very easy to use in most programming languages. Also, Base64url is URL-safe, so the tokens could be sent in the URL.
This is important because JWT enclosed two types of token: JWS, where the payload is encoded and signed so the integrity of the claims can be verified; and JWE, where the payload is encripted instead so the claims are hidden from other parties.
